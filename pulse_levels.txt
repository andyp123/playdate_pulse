Pulse levels:

Need 84 levels total, but probably want to start with lower number, like 12-24 and then build up

12 x 7 = 84 (all)
12 x 6 = 72

or

10 x 7 = 70
10 x 6 = 60

zones are horizontal rows of stages (on stage select). Player can only start from the first stage in each zone,
which are unlocked only once the player clears the previous row (?)

	DOOR
	KEY
	CLOCK
	ROTATE_LEFT - rotate controls
	ROTATE_RIGHT
	BLOCK_CLOSED
	BLOCK_OPEN
	SWITCH
	HEART
	GEM

Additions:
	ONEWAY_LEFT - solid, but the player can pass through to the other side in one direction
	ONEWAY_RIGHT
	ONEWAY_UP
	ONEWAY_DOWN
	SWITCH_ONCE - looks similar to a normal switch, but is activated once and then vanishes
	NEVER_BLOCK - in Space Filler mode will never turn into a block after the player steps off it

Mines (moving mines move each pulse and take an action only when they hit a non-empty block):
	MINE - stationary mine (touch and die)
	MINE_LR - mine that moves left and right
	MINE_UD - mine that moves up and down
	MINE_TR - mine that turns right
	MINE_TL - mine that turns left


Level Options:
Deep Breaths: The pulse either stops or slows way down (and changes sound), allowing the player more time to understand a gimmick/item
 - just used for the entry level of each zone
Piston: Blocks auto flip every 2 seconds. If player stands on a block when it moves, either game over OR the block stays open (getting out of sync on purpose)
 - sometimes used on stages with mechanical things
Space Filler: Blocks fill up as the player moves, forcing their path through the level to be considered.
 - starts appearing from zone 3
Gem Collector: Must get all the gems before the exit opens
 - sometimes used in all zones
Four Corners: Player must touch every tile at least once
Black out: The stage is only visible during a pulse

General Design:
- The first time very difficult/tricky gimmicks are introduced, provide the player with an easy heart
- Ease the player into the more confusing gimmicks, such as the level options and control rotating items
- Have a few super simple stages that are more like corridors between stages to allow the player to relax. These could even stop the pulse and have no timer.

Simple levels:
- keep items to just clock and key
- level gimmicks to just door

1 - Movement, clocks, doors and keys
2 - Mechanical (buttons and switches)
3

5
6
7 - everything no restrictions


1 - ENTRY (movement only)
2 - movement within time (longer stage with clock powerup)
3 - locked door with key
4 - more difficult locked door stage
5 - two doors block exit (se)
