PULSE TODO
----------

Immediate Tasks:
- Work on how the level editor is treated. Edit, play, reset. Should be separate to main game
- When in editor mode, player sprite should use black as transparent, and maybe flash inverted/invisible

- In between stage screen showing stage #, time taken on prev stage, total time etc. Should be 2 seconds or require button press to advance
- Game over screen (should perhaps use same code as above, but different state to show game over)

- Need a way to emphasize the last 3 seconds or so. Perhaps use sound, but visual effect helpful
- Need a better effect when time runs out

Done
x Stage items shouldn't clear until end of fade out
x Flip controls item (rotate 180) - much easier to understand than 90 degree increments. Rotation can be used from a later stage instead



- Ally's idea: use crank to rotate key to specific orientation
- level select menu
- user stage editing
- menu system and menus
  - stage options (play, edit, delete, duplicate, game/user stages toggle)
  - title options (see scores, go to stage select)
  - in game options (back to title, restart zone)
  - in editor options (play, save, revert, clear filled, clear empty)
- handle transitions better
  - title screen and game are white on black, most other screens are black on white
  - in between stage screen showing current time spent, lives left etc.
  - game over screen
  - high scores screen
- game over state
- game clear state
- 12 stages to start with
- think about modifications to gameplay... (5-7 modes?)
  - default controls
  - crank forward controls (hold direction and use crank to move forward)
  - dark mode (stage only visible during pulse)
  - instant death mode (pushing into a wall or door fails you)
  - all corners mode (touch every tile)
  - collector (get every special item/diamond)
  - no way back (blocks previously occupied are filled)
  - limited moves (each move is one second/pulse)
- move input from player to main loop
- move edit state from player to game
- input to player only during game and editor states
- perhaps move more stuff into the global.lua file?

Sounds Needed:
The current sounds are taken from the old web version of this game, and were
made with a tool called bfxr. They are bad but I thought they kind of fit the
game somehow. There's no need to stay so lo-fi.

What would be nice is the main pulse/time ticking sound gradually built up
in urgency along with the pulse jittering effect that affects the stage boundaries
as the timer nears zero. In general, stages take 10 seconds, but time can be
extended by 2 seconds at a time, and the stage might be be longer or shorter.

Playdate SDK has a few functions in the sound library for modifying sounds, but
obviously it's very simple compared wto wwise etc.

Midi type sounds can be generated, but you probably want to check out the
various filters that can be applied to samples.
Playdate also has a microphone if you have any cool ideas to use it.
