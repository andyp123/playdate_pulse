PULSE TODO
----------

HIGH PRIORITY:
- Practice mode should enable the user to practice all the stages on a row (if their best run reached that row)
- Force user to create user data on first start?
- More stages. Currently only ~60, but need 84
- Game over screen (using intermission code)
- Game clear screen (using intermission code)
- Improved icons for rotate and flip controls (remove dpad, clearer arrows)
- BUG: Can still move when time runs out, seems like a weird bug...
  - have reached the exit after time ran out
  - have moved into a wall too

- Need a better effect when time runs out
- Need a way to emphasize the last 3 seconds or so. Perhaps use sound, but visual effect helpful
- Highlight new high scores on the score table after finishing a game
- A few new sounds. New Stage Record, Hi score entered (should be on table), transition/fade sound

- When stages are done, remove editor from shipping builds/menus

LOW PRIORITY:
- Intermission screen polish?
- Practice mode intermission screen should be different somehow
- Transition should be black?
- Stage select should be white on black?
- PDF Manual
- Selection on level select screen moves when switching modes (could be player?)
- Stage items still fade weirdly when changing modes sometimes
- Allow crank input on menus in addition to dpad?
- When in editor mode, player sprite should use black as transparent, and maybe flash inverted/invisible

Done
x Pressing A on empty user data should open rename tool
x Should switch active user after create/rename?
x Remove weird clipping on move sound (Audacity can do?)
x Stage rebalancing for device (make everything way easier!)
x Key needs more black background for when on top of switches?
x Dummy data needed for userdata file (not users, but runs and stage times)
x High score screen showing max stage reached, total time taken and number of retries
x Work on how the level editor is treated. Edit, play, reset. Should be separate to main game
x Stage items shouldn't clear until end of fade out
x Flip controls item (rotate 180) - much easier to understand than 90 degree increments. Rotation can be used from a later stage instead
x Save best times for each stage in any play mode (just not when playing from edit stage)
x Save which stages have been cleared (could just use time?)
x In between stage screen showing stage #, time taken on prev stage, total time etc. Should be 2 seconds or require button press to advance
  x Stage intro: Stage #, total time, retries?   Prev cleared stage: time taken, best time (new record)





Game Ideas:
- think about modifications to gameplay... (5-7 modes?)
  x default controls
  - crank forward controls (hold direction and use crank to move forward)
  - dark mode (stage only visible during pulse)
  - instant death mode (pushing into a wall or door fails you)
  - all corners mode (touch every tile)
  x collector (get every special item/diamond)
  - no way back (blocks previously occupied are filled)
  - limited moves (each move is one second/pulse)
- perhaps move more stuff into the global.lua file?
- Ally's idea: use crank to rotate key to specific orientation
- use the crank for anything?



Sounds Needed:
The current sounds are taken from the old web version of this game, and were
made with a tool called bfxr. They are bad but I thought they kind of fit the
game somehow. There's no need to stay so lo-fi.

What would be nice is the main pulse/time ticking sound gradually built up
in urgency along with the pulse jittering effect that affects the stage boundaries
as the timer nears zero. In general, stages take 10 seconds, but time can be
extended by 2 seconds at a time, and the stage might be be longer or shorter.

Playdate SDK has a few functions in the sound library for modifying sounds, but
obviously it's very simple compared wto wwise etc.
https://sdk.play.date/1.11.1/Inside%20Playdate.html#M-sound

Midi type sounds can be generated, but you probably want to check out the
various filters that can be applied to samples.
Playdate also has a microphone if you have any cool ideas to use it.
