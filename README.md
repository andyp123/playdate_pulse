# Pulse for Playdate
A simple game where you must clear each stage within a strict timelimit.

The full source for my Playdate game Pulse, which you can buy for $3 on the [Catalog](https://play.date/games/pulse/) store or [Itch.io](https://mrflamey.itch.io/pulse) if you would prefer. The Catalog version has online scoreboards.

I realise it's weird to leave the source to a paid game public, but in this case the cost is minimal, and the hassle of setting up the SDK, building and sideloading seems high enough that people who would like to play it can just buy it.

This game was written in my spare time over a month or so. It seems like a long time for such a simple game, but most of the time was spent making the 84 levels and trying to balance them. It's quite messy source code, since a finished game is better than an unfinished one with clean code! I did mean to take this as a base and clean it up for further Playdate games, but as yet I have not been motivated to do so.
